if we put these commands in a batch file then commands will be executed line by line as we double click on that batch file.

Definition = A batch file is simply a text containing series of commands which are executed automatically line by line when the batch file is run.



Note = extension must be '.bat' and save it as 'all files' instead of text files. Type help in cmd to know more basic commands 

To know about using a particular command type
'command_name/?' without quotes
Eg. cd/?
